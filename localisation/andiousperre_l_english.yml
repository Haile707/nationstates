 #NATIONAL SPIRITS
 AND_imperial_march:0 "The Silver Legion"
 AND_imperial_march_desc:0 "Once a guild of likeminded Andiouan merchants and traders from across the Adriatic, the Silver Legion has evolved to become the largest fraternal organization in the country, open to all religions, races, and cultures. Driven by fierce patriotism for country and for the Legion, our soldiers fight all the better."
 AND_confederation_of_guilds:0 "Confederation of Guilds"
 AND_confederation_of_guilds_desc:0 "The Silver Legion may be the largest fraternal organization in Andiousperre, it is by no means the only one. A myriad of such cliques exist and all vie for power and dominance in the Confederacy. Out of all of these, one particular order stands out, that of the Hapsburg pretender, August. His powerbase in Trieste, the gateway to the east, has brought great power and respect."
 AND_overextended_colonialism:0 "Overextended Colonialism"
 AND_overextended_colonialism_desc:0 "The Andiouan-dominated administration has always had a deep-rooted desire to reclaim their homelands, and frankly, the Italians don't mind, such is the level of integration of the Andiouans in Italy. Of course, the vast territories conquered from the Yugoslavs have been resisting settlment and pacification efforts, and they grow bolder by the day."
