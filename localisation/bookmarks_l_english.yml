 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Twelve Years of Independence"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although the Empire of Whitecrest has long been dismantled, its successor, the Federation, is still alive and kicking. Although its influence is next to none, the nation that 'compose' the Federation are all powerful players in their own right. They have grown out of the shadow of Whitecrest, but what now?"
 BOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the middle of Federation stands Boroff. Instrumental in the Empire's downfall, Boroff remains to this day one of the most powerful players in the Federation of Whitecrest. All is not well, however, as Conservatives resist the 'socialist' regime, and as Biermann continues to subver the regime from within.\n\nThe fate of Boroff hangs in the balance, but whether it lies with Biermann or Koch, is to be seen..."
 KIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The first of the provinces to secede from the empire, Kinloss is a leading power in the Federation, boasting the largest navy, alongside having colonies of its own. The country is currently experiencing political turmoil following recent events regarding skirmishes with the Whitecrestian holy navy, and its foreign policy is agreed by all within the government, and that is Revenge for 1924."
