 #NATIONAL SPIRITS

 BOR_civil_reconstruction_authority_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the Borian Civil War, the CRA was founded under Governor Biermann as a non-partisan governmental organization in charge of rebuilding the country from the ruins of war. While it has been successful in this regard, the CRA has become a political player in its own right. And although the wounds of the Civil War have long faded, after twelve years a Constitution still has not been created, and what many call the 'Eternal Reconstruction' may continue, indefinetely..."
 BOR_constitutional_centralization:0 "Constitutional Decentralization"
 BOR_constitutional_centralization_desc:0 "Although the Treaty of Bremen, which ended the Borian Civil War, mandates that provinces would have their own assemblies and ratify Federal legislation independently, Governer Biermann has routinely forced the provincial governments to bow to his will. While it is technically legal under the CRA, this has led to a deep distrust of the Governer amongst the provincial assemblies."

 BOR_occupation_of_whitecrest_desc:0 "When the Empire fell, we took the decision to occupy the homeland of our conquerers. While we may have defeated them in war, they still stand defiant against our will. Boroff has to spend considerable resources to keep Whitecrest in check."

 #LEADER DESCRIPTIONS
 werner_biermann_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 18th of April, 1902, in Bremerhaven, Bremen, the Federal Republic of Boroff\n\n§YPersonal Life:§W Born to a no-name lower-class family, Werner Biermann was simply one of the many destitute children wandering the streets. His destiny seemed to be that of his father, a dockyard worker. By pure chance, he met the renowned Borian philosopher [TBD], who saw something in the young child. He paid for his education, and Biermann did not let him down. He was thrust into the national limelight when he won the coveted Imperial Scholarship.\n\nHe went abroad to further his studies, and by pure luck missed the destruction of the Civil War. When he returned, he was one of the few people who wasn't tainted by the vicious partisan struggle in the aftermath of the Treaty of Bremen, which he masterminded. As such, he was chosen to lead the Civil Reconstruction Authority as a effectively neutral leader, taking the title of Governer. His tenure has been successful, but his true goals remain hidden from public eyes. It remains to be seen if he will hand over his power to a democratically elected government, as mandated by the Treaty..."
