 FED_member:0 "Member of the Federation of Whitecrest"
 FED_member_desc:0 "This nation is a Signatory of the Treaty of Copenhagen, which dismantled the old Empire of Whitecrest and gave full independence to all Imperial provinces under the pretext that Empire would 'endure' in the form of a nascent federation. In practice, the Federation has since become defunct and all members act on their own will."

 BAR_KIN_naval_arms_race:0 "Naval Arms Race"
 BAR_KIN_naval_arms_race_desc:0 "As the provinces bordering the vast Atlantic and (and in the case of Barstana) the Mediterranean Sea, Kinloss and Barstana have both recieved massive investment from Whitecrest for their naval capacity, and most of the Imperial fleet was stationed in these two provinces when the Empire collapsed. As much of burden these fleets may be, their very existence created a protracted arms race between Kinloss and Barstana. The emphasis on naval affairs does mean that other matters take second priority."
