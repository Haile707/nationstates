 FED_member_desc:0 "This nation is a Signatory of the Treaty of Copenhagen, which dismantled the old Empire of Whitecrest and gave full independence to all Imperial provinces under the pretext that Empire would 'endure' in the form of a nascent federation. In practice, the Federation has since become defunct and all members act on their own will."
