 whitecrest.1.d:0 "In the wake of our defeat in the Independence War and the signing of the Treaty of Copenhagen, our glorious leader. Vidkun Quisling, was hanged by the victorius Borians. In his place, they have appointed the a pathetic collaborator, which was Alex Lassen. While he thinks he controls us, we know better.\n\nNow, our assassins will dispose of him. Where Vidkun failed to kill the military prime minister in '22, his true successor will succeed in '36."

His guards were unable to apprehend the man, who escaped in a black sedan. Lassen was escorted to the Copenhagen Hospital, were he was pronounced dead an hour later.\n\n In the confusion of the day, political rival Eric Scanvenius has proclaimed himself the new head of the Norse Church. It is expected that the radical Scavenius will seek to reclaim his people's old empire."
